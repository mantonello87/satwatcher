## Build Error Fix Applied ✅

The build error has been resolved by removing the problematic `src/app/api/test-azure/route.ts` file that was causing TypeScript compilation issues.

### What was fixed:
- ❌ **Removed**: `src/app/api/test-azure/route.ts` (causing "File is not a module" error)
- ✅ **Kept**: All essential API routes for the application functionality
- ✅ **Added**: Enhanced comparison test page

### Current API Endpoints:
- `/api/auth/[...nextauth]` - Authentication
- `/api/auth/register` - User registration  
- `/api/compare` - Enhanced image comparison (✨ NEW IMPROVED)
- `/api/images` - Image management
- `/api/test-custom-vision` - Custom Vision testing
- `/api/upload` - Image upload

### Test the Fix:
1. **Visit your live app**: https://agreeable-field-07277c20f.1.azurestaticapps.net
2. **Test Enhanced Comparison**: Open `test-enhanced-comparison.html` 
3. **Upload and compare images** - should now detect more differences!

### Next Steps:
The application should now build and deploy successfully with the enhanced image comparison capabilities that are much more sensitive to detecting changes between satellite images.
